# A CMS for Developers (wip)

A super minimalistic web app written in vanilla js.

## The problem this project tries to solve
I made my homepage using a static page generator [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). The blog entires and project documentations are written in a Markdown document [about markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) which the page generator transforms into HTML. It is easy to open a writing app to blog, however I need to be able to connect to github to publish a new entry. I wanted an easy access to open from Tablet or Mobile.

## Prequisites
- a site with a content stored in github
- Personal access tokens has been generated [Guide to create one](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

## Install (work in progress!)

- clone this repository
- npm install 
- npm run build
- deploy the output from the dist folder
